      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Simeon, better known as Monkata/Simo. I'm struggling with autism since my parents, shamelessly, decided to vaccinate me. Ever since I've had trouble reading, typing, and even speaking. I'm socially awkward, I like monkeys and my
        favorite food is crayons :)</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I thought that I had some skills. Apparently, I don't really know what I'm doing. I am learning. Because I am retarded I am learning very slowly but oh well... I'm sure ill become a great programmer one day.</p>

        <h3>Pants</h3>
        <p>If programming is not my strong suit then putting my pants on without using my hands is definitely the best thing I'm at!</p>

      <p>If you wish to contact me, I'd understand. I am pretty awesome, after all, look at my personal page. Buuuut please don't... I kind of wouldn't want to talk to you anyway. So I'm just going to leave you with a quote instead of providing you
        with my contacts :)</p>
